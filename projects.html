          <h3 class="project-title">Intelligent Virtual Assistants and Data Privacy</h3>
          <p class="project-details">
            This study explores Intelligent Virtual Assistants (IVAs), their functionality, and the evolving process of linking user devices to servers 
            with deep neural networks. IVAs, adept at responding to user queries, have adapted their procedures to address rising concerns about privacy and consumer rights.
             Many IVA companies have restricted third-party access to speech data, enhancing data security. However, opacity persists in technology companies'
             data usage practices, necessitating user understanding without navigating complex privacy policies. The research highlights the industry's heavy reliance 
             on advertisements, urging transparent data privacy practices and enhanced user protection.

            In conclusion, the study calls for increased accountability in the technology sector, focusing on addressing antitrust violations. By exposing the challenges related to IVAs and data privacy, the research emphasizes the need for informed user consent, robust privacy measures, and heightened transparency to uphold ethical standards in the digital era.
